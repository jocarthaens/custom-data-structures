A custom implementation of data structures such as dynamic arrays and hash tables. Features a flat hash map that utilizes robin hood hashing for storing key-value entries, a versatile dynamic array that can be used as either a list, double-ended queue, or stack, a caching data structure that stores unused object of the same type for future reuse, an object pool that generates and pools its own objects, and a write-protected tuple where its stored data can be overriden if an inputted key object has matched the tuple's initialized key object.
